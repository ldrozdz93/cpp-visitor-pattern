# Benchmark
Runtime overhead for the following implementations was tested:

###Competitors:

- BASELINE: a pure **virtual call** via a base class pointer
  - no visitor pattern at all 
  - instance allocated on the heap as a ```unique_ptr```, which in practice is the simplest and the most common rival to
  using the visitor pattern in the first place.
- Visitor pattern ```vstor```
  - uses double dispatch: first virtual, then ```std::variant``` based
- Visitor pattern by **Fedor Pikus**: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Design-Patterns-with-CPP/blob/master/Chapter18/04b_visitor_template.C
    - uses double virtual dispatch: first on the visitable, second on the visitor
- Visitor pattern by  **Arthur Oâ€™Dwyer**: https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/09/29/oop-visit/
    - uses sequential typeid comparison
- **std::variant**
    - uses single runtime dispatch (non-virtual based)
  
### Used compilers:
- gcc-10
- clang-10

###Scenario 1:
A class hierarchy of 1 pure virtual base class and 10 derived classes is defined, 
but only one derived class is constructed. We then use each
of the calling strategies mentioned above to compute a value for that instance.

The specific benchmark implementation depends on what api is required by the competing 
implementation, so see [benchmark.cpp](path to) for details.

###Scenario 2:
A class hierarchy of 1 pure virtual base class and 10 derived classes is defined,
and every derived class is pushed to a ```std::vector```. Next, the vector is shuffled.
We then iterate over all the instances and use each of the calling strategies mentioned 
above to compute a value for the given instance.

The specific benchmark implementation depends on what api is required by the competing
implementation, so see [benchmark.cpp](path to) for details.
